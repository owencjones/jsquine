# JS Quine

# Introduction
A Quine is a program that outputs its own source code.  Named after a concept by [Douglas Hofstader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter), Quines are a demonstration of [Turing Completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness).

Javascript being a Turing Complete language, it's possible to write a Quine in JS, but obviously the whole thing is a bit of a challenge in any language, because it's difficult to think around the problem - each change definitively changes the output and the source at once.
